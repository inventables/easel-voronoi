# voronoi-easel-app
An Easel app that fills shapes with a voronoi pattern

Depends on d3.js.

Because of a limitation in D3, it currently only works for filling convex shapes. I am in the process of updating it to use the Clipper library so that it will work for arbitrary shapes.

For this reason, the app is in progress and is currently marked as "private" in the Easel app store.
